    <h1><span class="title">The Famous Five</span></h1>

    <br>

    <p>The Famous Five are among Enid Blyton's best-loved creations and countless children have gone adventuring with <br>
        them since the publication of Five on a Treasure Island in 1942, the first of twenty-one full-length adventures <br>
        and numerous short stories.</p>

    <h1><span class="title">Heidi</span></h1>

    <br>

    <p>Sometimes when you read a "classic", it can turn out to be a disappointment. Not so with this book. <br>

        The story is about an orphan girl, Heidi, who has been sent to live with a lonely, angry man at the top of a mountain <br>
        in the Swiss Alps. This man is her grandfather. Heidi had been previously living with her Aunt Dete, but now Dete has <br>
        been appointed to a job in Frankfurt. There is no way she is going to turn down this job to look after Heidi; she has to go.<br>
        Surprisingly, Heidi's grandfather turns out to be welcoming and loving and lets Heidi stay in his mountain home, which she adores.</p>

    <h1><span class="title">Wonder</span></h1>
    
    <br>

    <p>Wonder is an excellent book that tells a moving and inspiring story. It’s fast-moving and gripping too. I found myself reading it on <br>
        the bus even if I only had time to read a couple of pages. It appeals to all age groups and is very popular with teenagers and adults. <br>
         Auggie is a very likeable central character. He’s got a good sense of humour, so the book is both funny and sad at times. It’s a <br>
         fascinating story about a regular kid who’s living in a world that’s not used to people who look different.</p>
